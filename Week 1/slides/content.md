# What's a web app?

From Wikipeida:

> In computing, a web application or web app is a _clientâ€“server_ computer program which the client (including the user interface and client-side logic) runs in a _web browser_. Common web applications include webmail, online retail sales, and online auction.

This isn't a great definition (as we'll see later), basically because *all* websites are client-server computer programs which run in a web browser.

# What's the difference between a web app and a website?

Have a think about this for a few minutes, then try to find:

1. An example of a website
2. An example of a web app

[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jxpZ7szLpstXQ7wvb23Y5_nDpsSx1Sg36X4YAtmU5lw/edit?usp=sharing)

Add a note with your chosen URLs, and another note with what you think the difference is between a website and a web app.

# What's the difference between a web app and a website?

From Wikipeida:

> _The general distinction between a dynamic web page of any kind and a "web application" is unclear_. Web sites most likely to be referred to as "web applications" are those _which have similar functionality to a desktop software application_, or to a mobile app.

---

# So, what's a web app again?

We'll use the following definition from here on in:

> A web app is an application built using _web technologies_ that runs in a web browser. It gives _users_ access to application-specific _functionality_ which allows them to perform operations on information stored in a _database_.

__Example web apps__:

Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, Google Docs

__Example websites__:

BBC News, Google.com

## In reality, all non-static (i.e. sites that use a database) websites are technically web apps!

# How do web apps work?

<img src="images/request.png">

* The front-end of the application is downloaded and runs in the users browser (HTML, JS, CSS)
* A user interacts with the front-end of the applicaiton to manipulate data (via forms or other UI controls)
* This data is submitted via a _request_ to the back-end (server-side) part of the app (Javascript & SQLite in our case)
* The data is persisted, and the app UI is updated to reflect the changes (by sending a _response_)

---

# Web technologies

**What we'll cover**

### Client Side (Front-end)

* HTML, Javascript, CSS

### Server Side (Back-end)

* NodeJS (server-side Javascript) & SQLite

---

# Web technologies

There are *lots* of server-side (back-end) languages and databases that we could use, but we'll stick to Javascript and SQLite for the duration of the module. There are *some* options on the client-side (front-end), but they will always be transpiled in to HTML and Javascript so they can run in the browser.

> You are free to use *any* language(s) and database you wish to implement your web app, if you feel confident in doing so

---

# Web technologies

**Some alternatives**

### Client Side (Front-end)

* Front-end frameworks (VueJS, React)

### Server Side (Back-end)

#### Languages

* PHP, Ruby, Python

#### Databases

* PostgreSQL, MongoDB

# Users

Users == People

* User accounts are required to log in and access (some / all) of the web app functionality
* User accounts allow multiple users to use the same app (i.e. access and run the same code)
* A particular users data is associated with their user account

---

# Functionality

Functionality == Features

Some examples:

* Editing documents
* Managing photos
* Creating posts, comments
* Uploading files (photos, images, audio, PDFs)

---

# Databases

* Stores content created by users
* Are generally 'relational' - i.e an item of data can be related to another (e.g. a 'Post' can be related to the 'User' who created it)
* Allow us to perform queries against the data (e.g. 'Return all the Posts by User id 1 that were created in the last 7 days')
